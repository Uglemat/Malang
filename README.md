# Malang

Malang is a small functional programming language. It's pretty useless, but it was fun to make.

It's made in Python 3 and depends upon Python Lex-Yacc. In Debian (and probably Ubuntu), you can install it
with `sudo apt-get install python3-ply`.

The efficiency of this implementation of the language is of little concern.

Enter this in the shell to start dashing out compound expressions in the REPL:

    $ ./malang.py -i

Here's an example session:

# Overview

It has lexical scope, closures, modules, dynamic typing, tail call elimination, higher order functions, pattern matching, list comprehensions and and and ....

There are no mutable values in Malang, so you can't change a value 'in place'.

All functions take exactly 1 argument (but they can take tuples as arguments, and use currying).

All functions are anonymous. Functions are values, and can be bound to a name.

Pattern matching is the only way to bind identifiers to values. You can't 'rebind' an
identifier, once you've said that A := 3, you can't change it. A is 3 always.

The only way to loop is to use recursion and with list comprehensions. The control flow
constructs are 'case of', 'throw/catch' and 'if then else' (plus the filters in list comprehensions).

# Values

There are 8 types of values: numbers (only integers), strings, atoms, tuples, lists, functions, builtins and modules.
And then there are bools and dicts, which are made out of other types.


## Numbers

Numbers have the syntax `(<base>#)?<number>` where base can be from 2 (for binary) to 16 (for hexadecimal),
and base defaults to 10 (decimal). Note that `<base>` and `<number>` above are not expressions.

You can use numbers in patterns. `16#FF := 255` is no problem, it will match.

## Strings

Strings are what you'd expect, like `"string with \" < quote and \\ < backslash "`. Any character following a
backslash is escaped, even if it doesn't have a special meaning like \n and \t, so "\hay" is the same string
as just "hay".

You can use strings in patterns.

## Atoms

Atoms are tokens that match the regex `[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`, and are just values that you can use
in your programs (in tuples, et cetera). The keywords of the language aren't atoms, so you can't have
an atom like `if`, `case` or `end`, that would be a syntax error.

You can use atoms in patterns.

## Identifiers

Identifiers are names which are bound to values, and they must match the regex `[A-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_'?]*`.
The identifier `_` is special, it will match anything and is never bound to anything. The `@` is also a
special identifier (described in the Functions section below).

You can use identifiers in patterns, both if they are bound and unbound, with different semantics.

## Tuples

A tuple is an ordered collection of items, surrounded by `{` and `}`, like this: `{1, 2, 3}`.

You can use tuples in patterns.

## Lists

Lists have almost the same syntax as tuples: `#[1, 2, 3]`. They are implemented as linked lists.


You can use lists in patterns.

### The cons operator:

The `::` (or cons) operator is used to prepend an item to a list. `hello::#[1, 2, 3]` creates the list
`#[hello, 1, 2, 3]`. `hello::#[]` creates `#[hello]`. The operator is right-associative, so you can write
`1::2::3::#[]` which creates `#[1, 2, 3]`.

It can also be used it patterns, to match the 'head' and 'tail' of a list.

### List comprehensions

You can use list comprehensions to create new lists. This is the syntax:

    #[<elem_expr> | <emitter1>, <emitter2>, ... <emitterN>]

Where the syntax of the 'emitters' are:

    <pattern> <- <expr>

or just

    <filter>

Where `<expr>` should evaluate to a list, tuple, number or string, and every element/character will be pattern-matched
agains `<pattern>`. In the case where `<expr>` is a number, it'll pattern-match all numbers from 1 up to that number.

If the emitter is a `<filter>`, then `<filter>` should be an expression, and it will only allow elements into the new
list if that expression evaluates to a truthy value.

The list comprehension works the way they do in other languages, and it's a little tedious to explain how
they work, so I'll just give a couple of examples:

    Malang> L := #[1,2,3,4,5].
    #[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Malang> #[Elem * 2 | Elem <- L].
    #[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    Malang> #[Elem | Elem <- L, Numbers:Even? Elem].
    #[2, 4]
    Malang> Elem.
    Error: Identifier 'Elem' not bound to a value at line #1 in file '<REPL>'
    Malang> #[{Elem1, Elem2} | Elem1 <- L, Elem2 <- L, Elem1 >= Elem2*2].
    #[{2, 1}, {3, 1}, {4, 1}, {4, 2}, {5, 1}, {5, 2}]

As you can see, all the identifiers bound inside the list comprehension are forgotten, they only exist inside `<elem_expr>`
and any *later* emitters (so an identifier bound in `<emitter2>` is available in `<emitter5>`, but not in `<emitter1>`.

`#[Elem * 2 | Elem <- L]` is just another way of saying `Lists:Map [@*2.] L`, and `#[Elem | Elem <- L, Numbers:Even? Elem]`
is just another way of saying `Lists:Filter Numbers:Even? L`.

In the last line you can see an example of more than one emitter that isn't a filter. In that case, it'll try all permutations.

## Dicts

Dicts are just lists of two-tuples of the form `{<key>, <val>}`, so they are what you'd call an 'alist' in a language like Lisp.

## Booleans

The boolean values in malang are the atoms `yeah` and `nope`. The purpose of choosing those atoms rather than `true` and `false`
is twofold:

 1. `yeah` and `nope` aligns perfectly in a monospace font
 2. `true` and `false` are old-fashioned, `yeah` and `nope` are hip and cool.

### Truthyness

These are the 'falsy' values: `{}`, `0`, `nope`, `""` and `#[]`. All other values are considered
'truthy'.

The filters in list comprehensions, and the conditional expressions in the `if then else` constructs are places where
you can use truthy and falsy values and it will work as expected. Also, a 'predicate function' in malang does *not* have to
return either `yeah` or `nope`, they just have to return a truthy or falsy value, and it should work as expected.

# Syntax and semantics

A Malang program is a list of compound expressions.

A compound expression is 1 or more expression seperated by commas, ending with a dot. For example:

    1, 3 + 1, "hello".

or

    "Hello".

The value of a compound expression is the value of the last expression.

Whitespace (including newlines) are not significant in Malang.

## Functions

A function is a list of compound expressions surrounded by square brackets. For example:

    [1, 3. 
     {atom, "string"}.]

The above function will always return the tuple `{atom, "string"}`, because functions returns the value
of the last compound expression.

The function body will be evaluated in an environment that inherits from the environment in which the function was
defined. Thus, Malang has lexical scope, like all other languages. With the honorable exception of Emacs Lisp.

### The @

As I said eariler, all functions take exactly one argument. It is automatically bound to the special
identifier `@`. The `@` will shadow any outside `@` that may exist.

### Documentation strings

If the first expression in a function body is a string, then that string will be the documentation string
for that function.

In the library code, I use a standard format for documentation strings, like this:

    @ = <arguments>

    blabla bla

If `<arguments>` looks like this: `{Omg, Yah}` it means that the function expects a two-tuple. If it looks like
this: `Omg Yah` it means that the function is curried, and `Omg` and `Yah` are the first and last arguments,
respectively. Pretty much all the functions in the library code are curried.

## Builtins

Builtins are functions implemented in the host language that are callable from malang. You use them the same way.
Some functions might disallow builtins as arguments, that's the only place you have to care about the difference, I think.

## Bind operator

You pattern-match with the 'bind' operator, ":=". Like this


    Three := 3.
    {One, {Two, Three}} := {1, {2, 3}}.

It will evaluate the right side expression and try to match it with the left side pattern.
If it sees an unbound identifier (an identifier that hasn't been pattern-matched already) it will just bind it to
the respective value on the right hand side. There's no limit on how deep you can 'nest' patterns.

This will only match tuples with two identical elements:

    Tuple := {"hay", "hay"}.
    {Same, Same} := Tuple.

Because the second time it sees `Same`, it is no longer an unbound identifier, and malang will insist
that it must match.

The resulting value of the bind operator is the same as the right hand side. Combine this with the fact
that the operator is right-associative and you can do stuff like this:

    Tup := {Fst, Snd} := {hello, yoyo}.

Which is parsed as `Tup := ({Fst, Snd} := {hello, yoyo}).` and thus does exactly what you'd expect.

The identifiers in a pattern are only bound if the pattern-match is successful. So if you evaluate
`{Same, Same} := {23, 11}`, then `Same` won't get bound because the pattern-match is unsuccessful. This
is relevant when you use the REPL, which just reports errors that happens, and when you use `catch`.

## Function application

The syntax for function application is `<function> <argument>`.

Where `<function>` and `<argument>` are both expressions. Function application is left-associative,
so `Func Arg1 Arg2` is parsed as `(Func Arg1) Arg2` (`Func Arg1` better return a new function, or else
that'd be an error).

There's also the `$` operator that you can use to call a function with an argument.
This is how it's used:

    <function> $ <argument>
    
The utility of the `$` operator is that it is right-associative (as opposed to normal function application)
and has a very low precedence. So you can sometimes get rid of lots of parentheses. As an example, this:

    Strings:Length (ToStr ([@ * 2.] 83)).

can be replaced by this:

    Strings:Length $ ToStr $ [@ * 2.] 83.

or this, using the function composition operator (described in the 'Operators and such' section below):

    Strings:Length ~ ToStr ~ [@ * 2.] $ 83.

All those lines do the same thing, but I think the bottom 2 are more aesthetically pleasing. And I really
know what I'm talking about.

## Case of

The `case of` construct is like the `:=` operator, except it tries to pattern match on several patterns,
and stops once a pattern matches, and executes the corresponding compound expression in a *new* environment
that inherits from the outer environment. Note it's a new environment, so the bindings made from the pattern
matching and in the compund expression are forgotten once the `case of` is done evaluating. The syntax is

    case <expr> of
      <pattern1> -> <compound_expr1>
      ...
      <patternN> -> <compound_exprN>
    end

The `<expr>` above is evaluated in the outer environment (so any identifier bindings will be remembered).

## If then else

The syntax for the `if then else` construct is

    if <expr>
      then <consequent_compound_expr>
      else <alternative_compound_expr>
    end

It will evaluate `<expr>` in a new environment that inherits from the outer environment, and then, depending on the
truthyness of the result, will decide which compound expr to evaluate (in the same environment that `<expr>` was evaluated
in). So, as with `case of`, any identifiers bound in the compund expressions will be forgotten once `if then else` is done.

## Catch/throw

`catch` and `throw` are control flow contructs, and can be useful for example if you're in a deep recursion and want 'return'
some special value, maybe to signify an error, or a successful search.

`catch` syntax: `catch <expr>`

The value of `catch` is a tuple of the form `{no_throw, <value>}` if everything goes as planned when evaluating `<expr>`,
where `<value>` is the value of `<expr>`. If anything is thrown inside `<expr>` however (and that inludes anywhere inside any
functions that may be called), then the value of the `catch` is that value.

`throw` syntax: `throw <expr>`

Stop execution and `throw` the value of `<expr>`. The program will crash unless something `catch`es it.

Malang will throw a value of the form `{error, <reason>}` whenever an error occurs. This will be recognized by the REPL as
an error. You may also throw values of that form, and the REPL will not disciminate you.


## Operators and such

 Operators/other            | Associativity | Arity  | Explanation
 --------                   | ------------- | -----  | -------------
 `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `=` `!=` | Left          | Binary | Comparison operators. Values of different types has an inherent order, so they can be compared. Strings and tuples are compared lexicographically. The (not-)equals operator works for all types, but functions/modules/builtins aren't orderable.
 `+`                        | Left          | Binary | Add two things together. Works for numbers, strings, tuples, and lists.
 `-`                        | Left          | Binary | Subtract one thing from another. Numbers only.
 `-`                        | Right         | Unary  | Negation operator for a number on the right.
 `*`                        | Left          | Binary | Multiply one thing by another. Works for numbers. Also works if one operand is a number, and the other operand is a tuple, string, or list.
 `/`                        | Left          | Binary | Divide one thing by another. Only works for numbers. Does floor division (Malang doesn't have real numbers. Real numbers are complicated, therefore dubious. fo real).
 `%`                        | Left          | Binary | Modulo operator. Works in the same way as the modulo in python. Numbers only.
 `~`                        | Left          | Binary | Function composition, creates a new function out if its operands. `(F ~ G) X = F(G(X))`.
 `**`                       | Right         | Binary | Raises an operand to some power.
 Function application       | Left          | Binary | Calling a function with an argument.
 `:`                        | Right         | Binary | Evaluating an expression in the context of some module.
 `:=`                       | Right         | Binary | Match a value agains a pattern.
 `$`                        | Right         | Binary | Calling a function with an argument.
 `::`                       | Right         | Binary | Construct a list with a head and tail

### Precedence

The things at the top has higher precedence than the things at the bottom:

Prec.  | Operators/other
------ | ---------------
1      | `(...)` `#[...]` `{...}` `[...]` `case of` `if then else`
2      | `::` (cons operator) 
3      | `:` (Module access)
4      | Function application (`<func> <arg>`)
5      | `~` (Function composition)
6      | unary `-` (negation)
7      | `**`
8      | `*` `/` `%`
9      | `+` `-`
10      | `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `=` `!=`
11     | `:=`
12     | throw/catch
13     | `$` (Also function application)
14     | `,` (seperator)
15     | `.` (end of compound expression)

## Modules

You can use the builtin function `Require` to import modules. Like this:

    My_Module := Require "src/module.malang".

It will evaluate the program in the file specified, and then return a module.

When you are evaluating top-level expressions in a file (i.e. not something that's inside a function), then the working
directory should be the directory that that file is located in, and so you can use relative path-names when using
`Require`.

'Module access' is used to make use of a module, this is the syntax

    <module>:<expr>

It will evaluate `<expr>` in the context of `<module>`, or in other words, in the same environment, and then return it.
So you can use all the identifiers in the module inside `<expr>`. `<expr>` is usually just an identifier that points to
a function in the module, but it could be a more complicated expression, such as a tuple or a function expression. Why not.
You cannot bind new identifiers in `<expr>`, it is said to be evaluated in "readonly mode".

So if `My_Module` contains a function bound to the identifier `Factorial` then you can do this to use it:

    My_Module:Factorial 20000.

It evaluates `Factorial` in the context of `My_Module`, the result of that is a function, and it is then called with the
argument 20000.

### Module docstring

If there is a string bound to the identifier `ModuleDoc` in the environment of a module, then that string is the docstring
for that module, which the `Help` function will appreciate.

## Classified

Sometimes it's useful to hide some identifiers and expose others, for example if you're making a library and want to ensure
backwards compatibility. You can do that with the `classified` construct, this is the syntax:

    classified
    exposing <identifier1>
             <identifier2>
             ...
             <identifierN>
    where
    <compound_expressions>
    endify

It will evaluate all the `<compound_expressions>` in its own environment inheriting from the outer environment. When that's done,
it will 'copy' all the exposed identifiers (`<identifier1> ... <identifierN>`) to the outer environment. All those identifiers
have to be present in the environment of `<compund_expressions>`.

If you don't want to expose any identifiers, then you can use this alternative form instead:

    classified where
    <compound_expressions>
    endify

The value of `classified` is the value of the last compound expression.


## Comments

Comments start with `--` and lasts until the end of the line.

# Factorial example

Here is factorial written in Malang:

    Factorial := [
      case @ of
        1 -> 1.
        N -> N * Factorial (N-1).
      end.
    ].

The reason i write `Factorial (N-1)` is that function application has higher precedence than arithmetic operations
so `Factorial N-1` would be parsed as `(Factorial N) - 1`, which is not what I wanted.

That version of factorial is not tail recursive, however, and you can't really calculate `Factorial 20000` without
hitting the recursion limit of python. Here's a tail recursive version:

    Factorial_Tail_Recursive := [
      Helper := [
        {N, Acc} := @.
        if N <= 1
          then Acc.
          else Helper {N-1, N * Acc}.
        end.
      ].
      Helper {@, 1}.
    ].

With that version, you *can* calculate `Factorial 20000`.

# Map example

The map function is a higher-order function that applies a function to each element of something, for example a list.
Here's how you could implement it for lists:

    Malang> `Map := [
    ------>   {F, List} := @.
    ------>   case List of
    ------>     #[] -> #[].
    ------>     Head::Tail -> (F Head)::(Map {F, Tail}).
    ------>   end.
    ------> ].`
    [function]
    Malang> Map {[@ * @.], #[1,2,3,4,5]}.
    #[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
    Malang> Map' := [{F, List} := @, #[F Elem | Elem <- List].].
    [function]
    Malang> Map' {[@**@.], #[1,2,3,4]}.
    #[1, 4, 27, 256]
    Malang> 

The `Map'` above isn't very different from how the map is implemented in the `Lists` module:

    Map := Funcs:Curry 2 [
      "
      @ = Func List
    
      Applies `Func` to every elemement of `List` and returns the result.
      ".
      {Func, List} := @.
      #[Func E | E <- List].
    ].

The difference as you can see is that `Lists:Map` has a documentation string and is curried. The use of list comprehension is
more appropriate because it works for very long lists. The recursive `Map` created in the REPL above is not tail recursive and
is thus limited by python's recursion limit. And using the list comprehension is more readable, that's important too of course.

# Navigating the REPL

You can use the functions `Help` and `Env` to get information about things. Run `Help Help.` to get started.

You can use the function `Exhibit` to go 'inside' of a module when you're in the REPL.

The function `Use` is quite *use*ful for testing out a file in the REPL.

If you need to enter many lines into the REPL at once, you can do so by starting and ending with a \` character.
For example, you could enter the factorial function above into the REPL like this:

    Malang> `Factorial := [
    ------>   case @ of
    ------>     1 -> 1.
    ------>     N -> N * Factorial (N-1).
    ------>   end.
    ------> ].`
    [function]
    Malang> Factorial 5.
    120
    Malang> 

You can't have any characters before the first \` or after the last \`, and they must be on different lines.

You can use the `ClearEnv` function the clear the REPL environment of identifier bindings.

# Emacs mode

There's an emacs mode for this language in the file `malang-mode.el`. It has syntax highlighting, and some commands:

 * `C-c f` (`malang-insert-func`) will insert ":= " and a function (and will also insert a docstring if it's called with a prefix argument),
   so you just have to enter the identifier name for a new function and then use this keyboard shortcut.
 * `C-c c` (`maland-insert-case`) will insert the basic structure of a `case` construct.
 * `C-c i` (`malang-insert-if`) will insert the basic structure of an `if then else` construct.

It also tries to indent code. Keep in mind that the indentation is based on heuristics, and is not perfect. It's just meant to
make it a little bit easier to edit malang code. Don't expect to be able to indent large regions of code at once.

To use the mode, you can open `malang-mode.el` in emacs, enter `M-x eval-buffer`, then go into the buffer that has
malang code in it, and enter `M-x malang-mode`.

Or you can enter `M-x load-file RET path/to/malang-mode.el` and then `M-x malang-mode`.
